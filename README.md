# Coloooors
A little program which displays colors along with their names.

I wrote this little script using pygame. I extracted the colors and their rgb values from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors_(compact) with the help of GNU 'grep' and python's 're' module.

<b>Usage</b>

Press any keyboard key to change the color. It displays the color's name in the top left corner. There are 1537 different named colors.

<b>Footnote</b>

The version V0 had only 142 named colors. Those were extracted from https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/ along with their rgb values. The function 'giveColorV0' is a leftover from that project.
